# SAFE ORDER

This is a project for the Dolby.io hackathon in 2023. The target user is an intermediary who receives requests for audio sessions from people who have suffered violence.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4.  Start the project with `npm start`.

## User Story

1.  As a middleman, I can click "Answer phone call" buttons to answer each victim's request for the audio session.
2.  As a middleman, I can click "Read transcription" buttons to check out the transcription from each audio session.
3.  As a middleman, I can click "ACTIVE CALLS", "PENDING CALLS", and "MISSED CALLS" on the sidebar to filter each audio session request.

## Items to be confirmed

1.  I'm not sure if we have to complete the function before the presentation regarding this use case: As a middleman, I can join the audio conference call directly after clicking "Answer the phone". (This will involve server set-up and data requests)
